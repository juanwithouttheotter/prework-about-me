      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy cylcing througout the city on a bright sunny day. Sometimes knitting on the sofa on a cold day. Baking and Cooking various different recipes every other day.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one where I can effectively balance work life and home life.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Chicago in West Ridge aka West Rogers Park aka Little India neighborhood, depending on who you ask. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm finding there are a lot of things I could do and could be but web development seems to be calling my name. Maybe it's the brand new set of skills I don't already have... Or possibly the amount of organization or attention to detail... Probably go into educational software to make a slightly better impact on today's educational system.</p>
